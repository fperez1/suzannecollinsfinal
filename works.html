        <img src="assets/img/hungergames.jpg" class="pic">
        <p id="long">Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games.".</p>

        <h2>Catching Fire</h2>
         <img src="assets/img/catchingfire.jpg" class="pic">
        <p>Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.</p>
